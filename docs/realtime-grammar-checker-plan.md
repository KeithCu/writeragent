# Real-time / AI grammar checking — plan and status

**Status**: Shipped — UNO proofreader + engine + Linguistic `GrammarCheckers` XCU are bundled in default builds (`make manifest` / `make build`).  
**Authors**: WriterAgent Team  
**Audience**: Developers and PMs aligning on **native Writer linguistic grammar** vs optional **sidebar chat** (different surfaces, different jobs).

---

## 1. Native grammar vs chat (do not conflate)

| Surface | UX | Role |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Native Writer grammar (Linguistic2)** | Same as other grammar extensions: Writer’s grammar pass, underlines, grammar dialog. Uses `XProofreader` + `Linguistic` / `GrammarCheckers` registry. | **Shipped / experimental** — Python `XProofreader` + Lightproof-style XCU are in the default OXT; users enable LLM work on the **Doc** tab and pick the active proofreader under Writing aids. Earlier native crashes were fixed by accepting extra UNO constructor args (`__init__(self, ctx, *args)`). |
| **Chat with Document (sidebar)** | Multi-turn chat with document context and tools — not a duplicate linguistic pipeline. | Use this when you want **explanations, rewrites, or whole-paragraph help**; it does not replace underlined in-flow proofreading. |

There is **no** separate “poll the paragraph and append grammar blocks into chat” feature. That overlap is unnecessary: **Chat with Document** already provides document-grounded assistance with the same configured endpoint and models.

**Sentence-scoped native grammar vs document-wide comments**

- **Native Linguistic grammar** (`XProofreader`) feeds the LLM **only a capped proofread slice** of paragraph text—not the whole document—and builds requests from **sentence-sized units** cached **per sentence** (splitting described in §2.3). That keeps corrections local and reduces failures where models return broken JSON or bad offsets when asked to chew on **many error-dense sentences at once**. When several sentences in the slice are uncached, the worker may **concatenate** them into **one HTTP request**; in practice the flow is still **sentence-oriented**. Broader refactors remain a possible future change.
- **Whole-document editorial review** uses the **sidebar chat + tools** path: the model can read wide context and use **`add_comment`** ([`plugin/modules/writer/comments.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/comments.py)) to leave Writer comments on specific spans (copyeditor-style). Review-oriented instructions live in [`plugin/framework/constants.py`](../plugin/framework/constants.py) (`TOOL_USAGE_PATTERNS`). Same HTTP stack; different job than in-flow underlines.
- **Compared to LanguageTool** (for integrators): LT analyzes the **full text the client submits** in one check, then **segments into sentences internally**; most XML rules match **inside one sentence**, with **some** cross-sentence logic via **special Java rules** or rarer patterns—not one-sentence API calls. WriterAgent’s **capped slice + per-sentence LLM cache** is a **product/engineering** choice for stable model output, not a copy of LT’s chunking policy. Detail: [`languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md`](languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md) (opening **WriterAgent / LLM grammar** section).

## 2. What we shipped (native grammar)

### 2.1 Code and packaging

- **UNO component**: [`plugin/modules/writer/ai_grammar_proofreader.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/ai_grammar_proofreader.py) — `WriterAgentAiGrammarProofreader` (`unohelper` + `XProofreader`, locales, service info). Standalone entrypoint: extends `sys.path` like [`plugin/modules/chatbot/panel_factory.py`](../plugin/modules/chatbot/panel_factory.py) so `import plugin.*` works when LO loads the module.
- **Engine (testable)**: [`plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py) — JSON parsing (`safe_json_loads`), offset normalization (with first-occurrence bias note), sentence-level LRU cache, ignore-rule set, hybrid sentence splitter, work-queue dedup.
- **Registry**: [`extension/registry/org/openoffice/Office/LinguisticWriterAgentGrammar.xcu`](../extension/registry/org/openoffice/Office/LinguisticWriterAgentGrammar.xcu) — fuses `org.extension.writeragent.comp.pyuno.AiGrammarProofreader` under `GrammarCheckers` with `Locales` set to a space-separated list of BCP-47 tags (one `oor:string-list` `<value>`, matching Lightproof). Tags are defined in [`grammar_locale_registry.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_locale_registry.py) as [`GRAMMAR_REGISTRY_LOCALE_TAGS`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py) (same coverage as shipped gettext `plugin/locales/` plus `en-US` / `en-GB`). Must stay aligned with `getLocales()` (UNO `Locale` per tag) and `GRAMMAR_REGISTRY_LOCALE_TAGS` (unit test enforces parity). Document **regional** `CharLocale` values normalize to the canonical tag per language for cache and the LLM prompt.
- **Bundle**: [`scripts/manifest_registry.py`](../scripts/manifest_registry.py) — `META-INF/manifest.xml` always lists the Python UNO module and `registry/org/openoffice/Office/LinguisticWriterAgentGrammar.xcu` in default `make manifest` / `make build` output.

### 2.2 Configuration

- **All settings (Doc tab)**: `doc.grammar_proofreader_*` in [`plugin/modules/doc/module.yaml`](../plugin/modules/doc/module.yaml) — enable (default **off**), wait timeout (ms), optional model (empty = same as chat `text_model`), and `doc.grammar_proofreader_pause_during_agent` (default **off**) to pause grammar API requests while sidebar chat/agent work is active. Proofread span length (500 chars) and LLM max output tokens (512) are **fixed in code** in [`ai_grammar_proofreader.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/ai_grammar_proofreader.py). The Doc tab also inlines Calc’s **Max Rows Display** (`calc.max_rows_display` via `config_inline: doc` in [`plugin/modules/calc/module.yaml`](../plugin/modules/calc/module.yaml)).
- **Diagnostics**: logger name `writeragent.grammar` — `INFO` lines prefixed `[grammar]` for each `doProofreading` call, cache hit/miss, worker skip/supersede, LLM request/result counts, and `WARNING` with stack trace on worker failure. Ensure `init_logging` has run (first grammar call attempts it); see `writeragent_debug.log` under the LO user config directory (see AGENTS.md).

### 2.3 Runtime behavior (summary)

- **`doProofreading`** (async return path): On a **full cache miss**, WriterAgent returns with empty `aErrors` and enqueues a work item. On a **partial cache hit** (some sentences cached, some not), it **returns the cached errors immediately** (better than empty — squiggles appear for already-checked sentences) and enqueues for the remaining uncached sentences. On a **full cache hit** all errors are returned directly, no enqueue needed. It **does not** wait inside `doProofreading` or pump `processEventsToIdle()` for results. That keeps **menus and chrome responsive** while grammar runs.
- **`doc.grammar_proofreader_wait_timeout_ms`**: No longer used by the proofreader return path (reserved for possible future options or removed from UI in a later cleanup).
- **Sidebar status**: the proofreader emits `grammar:status` for meaningful phases (`start`, `request`, `complete`, `failed`, etc.). Skipped work is not reported to the status bar.
- **Concurrency / work queue**: A single persistent daemon thread (`_GrammarWorkQueue`) drains a `queue.Queue` sequentially. On each iteration, the worker **batch-drains** all pending items and runs **`deduplicate_grammar_batch`** ([`grammar_proofread_engine.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py)) before processing survivors. This eliminates the prior stampede where N cache misses spawned N workers that all contended for `llm_request_lane` simultaneously.
- **Enqueue-time replace-in-place (O(1) tail check)**: `_GrammarWorkQueue.enqueue()` acquires `queue.Queue`'s own internal mutex (`self._q.mutex`) and checks the **last item** of the internal deque (`self._q.queue`). If it has the same `inflight_key` and the incoming item is newer (higher `enqueue_seq`), it **replaces it in place**. This efficiently collapses typing bursts into a single pending request without a loop. If no match is found at the tail, the item is appended normally.
- **Newest-wins dedup + stale suppression**: The drain-time **`deduplicate_grammar_batch`** pass remains as a belt-and-suspenders safety net: it handles items that slipped past the 10-item enqueue scan (e.g. a deep queue during a burst) and cross-key prefix dedup within each `(doc_id, locale)` group. Within each group, **prefix-related conflicts keep the newest request** (`enqueue_seq`). Items with the same `inflight_key` are also superseded by sequence number (highest survives). **`inflight_key`** is **`{aDocumentIdentifier}|{locale}`** (no slice text fingerprint): mid-sentence edits are not prefix-related, so a per-slice fingerprint would give every keystroke a unique key and defeat same-key supersede and prefix dedup. `_GrammarWorkQueue` additionally performs a **pre-execute stale check** against `_latest_seq` and skips any survivor older than the latest known sequence for that key, which closes cross-batch race windows. This is combined with a 1-second pause mechanism: the worker collects requests and waits until there is a 1-second period of no new requests before processing the batch, ensuring checks only run when the user stops typing.
- **Queue diagnostics**: Explicit queue logs for enqueue, drain batch size, dedup survivors, stale-skip, and execute; each includes `doc_id`, `inflight_key`, `enqueue_seq`, slice length, and a compact text preview to diagnose intermittent ordering issues. Out-of-order sequence detection in `enqueue` logs at ERROR level if an incoming item has a lower sequence than the latest recorded for that key.
- **Sentence-level gating**: grammar checks run when the slice looks like a complete sentence (terminal punctuation heuristic with multilingual marks such as `. ! ? … ؟ 。 ！ ？ ।`) **or** when partial text reaches `GRAMMAR_PARTIAL_MIN_NONSPACE_CHARS` (15 non-space chars). Short incomplete fragments are skipped before cache/worker scheduling.
- **Sentence cache**: Cache is keyed by **individual sentence** text (locale + fingerprint, trailing whitespace stripped via `rstrip()`). `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` is **2048**. `split_into_sentences` ([`grammar_proofread_engine.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py)) uses a **hybrid approach**: for Western/CJK languages, it delegates to LibreOffice's native `BreakIterator` (via the `_get_break_iterator_and_locale` helper) with a custom heuristic to merge breaks after short abbreviations like "Mr.", "Dr.", "vs." — capped at 3-char words to avoid false positives on proper nouns like "USA.", "Tom."); for Thai, Lao, and Khmer, it intelligently splits on whitespace. On **lookup** (`doProofreading`): each sentence is checked independently — if **all** are cached, combined errors are returned immediately (no enqueue); on **partial hit**, cached errors are returned immediately (squiggles for checked sentences) while uncached sentences are enqueued. On **worker execution** (`_run_llm_and_cache`): the worker filters to only **uncached** sentences, concatenates them, sends only those to the LLM, and caches each sentence's errors independently.

  New (2026-05): For **incomplete** sentences (no terminator), `cache_put_sentence` performs a cheap newest-first scan (max 10 recent entries) to evict any incomplete strict-prefix predecessors for the same locale. This prevents LRU churn when a user types a long sentence incrementally ("The qu" → "The quick brown fox..."). Complete sentences are protected and never evicted. The common case collapses to 1 LRU slot. See `test_sentence_cache_incomplete_prefix_compaction`.
- **LLM**: [`LlmClient.chat_completion_sync`](../plugin/modules/http/client.py) with `response_format={"type":"json_object"}` on the OpenAI-compatible path (Together, OpenRouter, etc.; see docstring on `make_chat_request`), a system prompt (template moved to top of `ai_grammar_proofreader.py`) requiring a single JSON object `{"errors":[{"wrong","correct","type","reason"},...]}` (schema description in English) plus the **document language** (BCP-47 and English name from the registry), and user message the **batched checked slice** `aText[n_start:n_end]` (batching described in §3; capped at 500 characters in code). The prompt explicitly asks for errors in the order they appear. For threshold-allowed partial slices, the prompt adds a conservative note that input may be partial. Parser: [`parse_grammar_json`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py) uses `safe_json_loads` then `json_repair` (with logging) when needed.
- **Offset Normalization**: `normalize_errors_for_text` uses **`search_pos` tracking** to handle multiple occurrences of the same erroneous text within a window. It searches for `wrong` substrings starting from the last matched position, matching the LLM's ordered reporting. Global `full_text.find` fallback removed to ensure errors stay within their intended paragraph/slice.
- **`TextMarkupType.PROOFREADING`**: resolved with `uno.getConstantByName("com.sun.star.text.TextMarkupType.PROOFREADING")` (avoids fragile `TextMarkupType` submodule imports for typecheckers).

### 2.3.1 Why `enqueue_seq` exists (queue FIFO is not enough)

**Terminology.** The shipped code uses a **global integer counter** (`_ENQUEUE_SEQ` in [`ai_grammar_proofreader.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/ai_grammar_proofreader.py)), incremented when a cache miss enqueues work; each [`GrammarWorkItem`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py) stores it as **`enqueue_seq`**. This is **not** the same as `time.monotonic()` — that clock is used elsewhere only for **elapsed milliseconds** on LLM requests (status/diagnostics), not for ordering queue items.

**Why not rely only on “everything goes through `queue.Queue`”?** A FIFO queue orders **`get()` dequeue order** among objects that are actually retrieved in sequence. The grammar worker deliberately does **more** than strict FIFO:

1. **Tail replace-in-place** — For the same `inflight_key`, a newer item can **overwrite** the last slot of the internal deque without establishing a simple FIFO relationship to items already consumed in an **earlier** batch. Queue position alone does not record “this snapshot superseded that one” across batches.

2. **Batch drain + `deduplicate_grammar_batch`** — The worker collects multiple `get()` results into one batch, then resolves conflicts (same key and prefix-related slices). The implementation needs an explicit **“newest wins”** tie-break; it uses **highest `enqueue_seq`**, not only insertion index in the batch.

3. **`_latest_seq` / pre-execute stale skip** — Before calling the LLM, the worker asks whether a **newer** enqueue has already been recorded for that `inflight_key`. That can be true even when the physical queue does not place “newest next” (e.g. tail was replaced, or newer work will appear after the current drain). `_latest_seq[key]` holds the **last assigned sequence** for that key; each item carries its stamp so survivors can be compared to that mirror.

So **`enqueue_seq` is a generation stamp for supersede/dedup semantics**, not a substitute for the queue. Something must play that role whenever work is merged, replaced, or skipped outside pure FIFO.

**Alternatives (same role, different representation):**

| Approach | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| **Per-`inflight_key` counter** | Bump only when enqueueing for that document+locale key. Same semantics as today’s global counter for same-key comparisons; avoids mixing sequence space across unrelated documents (clearer for logs and reasoning). |
| **Enqueue-time monotonic value** | e.g. `time.monotonic()` at enqueue as the order key. Requires discipline if two enqueues share an identical timestamp resolution; still needs to be stored on each `GrammarWorkItem` and mirrored (like `_latest_seq`) for stale checks. |
| **Post-LLM staleness guard** | Keep a generation stamp **and** re-check before `cache_put_sentence` that no newer enqueue superseded this item while the HTTP call was in flight. The current pre-execute `_is_stale` does not cover the whole LLM duration; mitigations today include sentence-text–keyed cache (reduces wrong writes when text changes). |
| **Remove unused plumbing** | `_run_llm_and_cache` accepts `enqueue_seq` but does not use it inside the function body as shipped; a future change could either drop the parameter or use it for a post-LLM guard above. |

### 2.4 Tests

- Unit: [`plugin/tests/test_grammar_proofread_engine.py`](../plugin/tests/test_grammar_proofread_engine.py) — JSON parsing, offset normalization, sentence cache roundtrip, trailing whitespace cache normalization, ignore rules, overlap expansion.
- Unit (work queue dedup): [`plugin/tests/test_grammar_work_queue.py`](../plugin/tests/test_grammar_work_queue.py) — newest-wins prefix conflict resolution, supersede behavior, reverse-prefix chain reproducer (`"What is going on"` → `"W"`), mid-sentence non-prefix edits with shared `inflight_key`, mixed dedup, cross-locale independence.
- Unit (queue stale checks): [`plugin/tests/test_ai_grammar_proofreader_worker.py`](../plugin/tests/test_ai_grammar_proofreader_worker.py) — `_GrammarWorkQueue` stale detection behavior (`_is_stale`) for older-vs-latest sequence handling.
- UNO (native runner): [`plugin/tests/uno/test_ai_grammar_proofreader.py`](../plugin/tests/uno/test_ai_grammar_proofreader.py) — cache path and `ignoreRule` filtering.
- UNO (native runner): [`plugin/tests/uno/test_writer_sentence_splitter.py`](../plugin/tests/uno/test_writer_sentence_splitter.py) — tests the hybrid LO `BreakIterator` and Thai whitespace splitting heuristics.

### 2.5 Risks (still relevant)

| Risk | Mitigation shipped / notes |
|------|----------------------------|
| Token cost / privacy | Master switch **off** by default; user must enable on the **Doc** tab; Writer tab documents that checked text is sent to the configured endpoint. |
| UI freeze | `doProofreading` does **not** wait on the main thread for LLM results (avoids dead menus while grammar runs). HTTP/LLM runs on a background worker; underlines update on a **later** proofreading pass when the sentence cache is ready. |
| Stale underlines | Sentence cache (locale + sentence text fingerprint) plus sequential work queue with newest-wins dedup and pre-execute stale suppression coalesce calls. **Cache hit** → immediate errors; **miss** → empty return once, queue worker fills cache for the next pass. See §6 for evolving this. |
| Concurrent chat agent | Optional guard (`doc.grammar_proofreader_pause_during_agent`) can skip grammar worker calls while chat/agent sends are active; grammar and chat/agent LLM requests also share one in-process request lane to avoid overlap races. |

## 3. Lightproof-inspired optimizations

As of **2026-04-25**, the native grammar checker implements two key optimizations inspired by the `lightproof` project to handle long documents efficiently:

1.  **Paragraph-level batching (Lightproof-aligned)**: On the `nStart == 0` pass, the proofread window is **`aText[0:min(len(aText), 500)]`** (hardcoded in [`ai_grammar_proofreader.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/ai_grammar_proofreader.py)) with `ProofreadingResult` positions finalized via `_finalize_proofreading_sentence_positions` (same idea as [`lightproof/Lightproof.py`](../lightproof/Lightproof.py) after the LO 4 patch). This avoids LLM/cache work on each one-character extension of the sentence.
2.  **Sentence-level caching**: The old slice-level cache (`_proofread_cache` / `make_cache_key` / `cache_get` / `cache_put` keyed by doc + locale + fingerprint + bounds) has been **removed**. All caching now goes through the **sentence-level cache** (`cache_get_sentence` / `cache_put_sentence` in [`grammar_proofread_engine.py`](../plugin/modules/writer/grammar_proofread_engine.py)). Normalization uses `_normalize_for_sentence_cache` so that trailing whitespace is stripped **and** any punctuation after the *first* sentence terminator is ignored for the cache key (`"Hello."` and `"Hello..."` share a key; `"Hello?"` and `"Hello?..."` share one; but `"Hello?"` vs `"Hello."` remain distinct). Errors are clipped to the canonical length. This means semantically equivalent sentence text anywhere in the document reuses the same errors regardless of document position or trailing punctuation style. See §2.3 "Sentence cache" for the full lookup/storage behavior.

## 4. Optional reference: `GrammarChecker.py`

The standalone [`GrammarChecker.py`](../GrammarChecker.py) (root of repo) was used historically as a prompt/threading reference. It is **not** bundled as WriterAgent product code. The shipped proofreader does **not** call it.

---

## 5. Future work (suggested backlog)

### Native grammar — hardening and product

1.  **Native Linguistic Integration**: Research using the built-in `SpellChecker` with specialized XML queries (e.g., `<query type='analyze'>`) to perform morphological analysis (stems, part-of-speech) locally before or during LLM work (inspired by `lightproof` morphology caching).
2.  **429 / backoff**: exponential backoff and cooldown in the grammar worker; optionally skip scheduling when sidebar chat is mid-request (shared policy flag).
3.  **Locales**: shipped: `GRAMMAR_REGISTRY_LOCALE_TAGS` matches gettext `plugin/locales/` + `en-US` / `en-GB`; optional future regional tags in the XCU if a given LO build requires explicit `hasLocale`/`getLocales` pairing beyond normalization.
4.  **Refresh UX**: LO only shows new squiggles on **subsequent** proofreading passes; document for users; optional future hook if LO exposes a safe “invalidate proofreading” API worth researching.
5.  **Optional model / temperature**: surface more controls in Settings if needed (currently optional grammar model + shared endpoint).
6.  **LRU cache tuning**: **Shipped (baseline):** sentence-level LRU (**2048** entries, `MAX_CACHE_SIZE`). Includes newest-first bounded scan (max 10 recent entries) for incomplete-sentence prefix compaction to avoid churn on long typing sessions. The old slice-level cache has been removed. See `grammar_proofread_engine.py:cache_put_sentence` and new tests. Further ideas: per-document invalidation, TTL, or stats in UI.
7.  **Document-generation invalidation**: If LO exposes a revision counter, generation id, or “document modified” tick, fold it into the cache key or force miss when the full buffer changes even if a slice string matches (reduces risk of stale absolute offsets after edits above the span).
8.  **Shared policy with chat**: Baseline shipped: optional pause-during-agent setting + shared in-process LLM request lane. Future expansion: endpoint-aware policy (per provider/model), richer status UX, and adaptive queue/backoff.
9.  **Smaller / faster grammar model**: Route grammar-only traffic to a cheaper or local model by default; keep “same as chat” as an override (already partially supported via `grammar_proofreader_model`).
10. **Prompt and schema hardening**: Few-shot examples for edge cases (quotes, lists, track changes); strict JSON recovery; optional `response_format` where the API supports it.
11. **Paragraph batching tuning**: If Writer scheduling or underlines misbehave on some LO versions, compare our capped batch end vs stock Lightproof’s `len(rText)` and adjust `_finalize_proofreading_sentence_positions` only.
12. **Ignore rules & parity**: Persist `ignoreRule` across sessions; locale-specific ignores if the API evolves.
13. **Observability**: Debug metrics (cache hit rate, worker supersede count, p50/p95 latency from schedule → `cache_put`) behind a verbose flag for field debugging.
14. **Accessibility / UX copy**: Clear user-facing text that grammar is **asynchronous** (squiggles after pause); link to Writing aids selection when multiple proofreaders exist.
15. **LanguageTool-class local checking (research)**: Phased roadmap for a **Python-first** checker consuming LT-open rule data toward LanguageTool-grade quality over time, **without JVM** in-stack (`nlprule`/fork accelerator optional). See [docs/languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md](languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md).

### Docs / agents

- Keep [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) in sync when behavior or config keys change (per project rules).
- Optional non-LLM checker roadmap grounded in LT behavior: [`languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md`](languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md).

## 6. Revision history (high level)

- **Earlier draft**: Described a separate sidebar polling + chat-append path; that direction was **dropped** in favor of native linguistic grammar plus existing **Chat with Document** for conversational help.
- **2026-04 (Late)**: Paragraph-level batching was attempted then reverted; cache uses **slice fingerprints** (Lightproof-adjacent ideas, see §3).
- **2026-04-26**: Lightproof-style **capped** batching re-enabled on `nStart==0` (`min(len(aText), 500)` + `_finalize_proofreading_sentence_positions`).
- **2026-04 (Mid)**: Native linguistic grammar **shipped** (Lightproof-style + LLM + cache); this document updated to match reality and list follow-ups.
- **2026-04 debugging**: Locale list fixed to Lightproof-style space-separated BCP-47 list; lazy imports; stub added.
- **2026-04-26**: Registry expanded to all shipped UI translation locales; `grammar_locale_registry` + normalized `CharLocale` for cache/LLM.
- **2026-04 resolution**: LibreOffice calls `createInstanceWithArgumentsAndContext` with extra args; proofreaders must implement `__init__(self, ctx, *args)`.
- **2026-04 (doc)**: Expanded backlog (cache evolution, cost control, LO integration); clarified §2.5 / §3 cache behavior vs. one-slot-per-doc limitation.
- **2026-04-27**: Replaced per-sentence `run_in_background` + debounce-sleep pattern with single sequential `_GrammarWorkQueue` (`queue.Queue` + one daemon thread). Added `deduplicate_grammar_batch` with prefix dedup + sequence-based supersede. Removed `GRAMMAR_WORKER_DEBOUNCE_MS`, `_INFLIGHT_JOBS`, `_wait_for_inflight_job`. `GrammarWorkItem` and dedup live in `grammar_proofread_engine.py` for UNO-free unit testing.
- **2026-04-27 (cache)**: Fixed critical cache bug — the "sentence cache" was caching whole-paragraph batches as one unit (any typing invalidated the key). Now uses true **per-sentence caching**: `split_into_sentences` splits on `[.!?…؟。！？।]+\s+`, lookup/storage operate per sentence. Added **trailing whitespace normalization** (`rstrip()`) so "Hello." and "Hello. " share the same cache key. **Partial cache hits** return cached errors immediately (better than empty). Worker filters to **only uncached sentences** before LLM call, skips entirely if all cached. Errors are attributed to individual sentences by position and cached independently.
- **2026-04-27 (pause)**: Modified `_GrammarWorkQueue._drain_loop` to wait for a 1-second pause in incoming requests before deduplicating and processing the batch, preventing worker stampedes and early LLM requests while the user is actively typing.
- **2026-04-28**: Implemented hybrid sentence splitting in `grammar_proofread_engine.py`. Switched from a pure-Python regex to LibreOffice's `BreakIterator` (for proper quote/ellipsis handling) augmented with a custom abbreviation heuristic, while retaining whitespace chunking specifically for `th`/`lo`/`km`. Moved sentence splitter tests to the UNO native test suite.
- **2026-04-28 (queue race fix)**: Changed grammar queue dedup semantics from longest-prefix-wins to **newest-wins** by `enqueue_seq` for prefix-related conflicts; kept same-key supersede by highest sequence. Added pre-execute stale suppression in `_GrammarWorkQueue` using `_latest_seq` so cross-batch stale survivors are skipped. Added queue diagnostics (enqueue/drain/survivors/stale-skip/execute) and regression tests in `test_grammar_work_queue.py` + stale checks in `test_ai_grammar_proofreader_worker.py`.
- **2026-04-28 (code review cleanup)**: Removed dead slice-level cache (`_proofread_cache`, `make_cache_key`, `cache_get`, `cache_put`) — all caching now sentence-level only. Fixed `_TRAILING_CLOSERS`: removed opening bracket `〖` (U+3016) and duplicate `〛`. Tightened abbreviation heuristic from `len(word) <= 5` to `<= 3` to avoid false-positive sentence merging on proper nouns ("USA.", "Tom."). Added first-occurrence bias comment in `normalize_errors_for_text`. Added comment + assertion + debug log for near-dead Lightproof fallback condition in `_finalize_proofreading_sentence_positions`. Added out-of-order sequence detection logging in `_GrammarWorkQueue.enqueue`. Replaced dead slice-cache tests with sentence-cache roundtrip and whitespace normalization tests.
- **2026-04-28 (hardening)**: Increased `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` to 512. Consolidated `BreakIterator` and `Locale` initialization into `_get_break_iterator_and_locale` helper. Improved `normalize_errors_for_text` reliability with `search_pos` tracking and removed global text search fallback. Moved `GRAMMAR_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` to top of `ai_grammar_proofreader.py` and updated prompt to explicitly request ordered errors. Added logging for `json_repair`.
- **2026-04-29 (json robustness)**: Fixed a silent JSON corruption bug in `safe_json_loads` (`json_utils.py`) where unescaped LaTeX commands starting with valid JSON escape characters (e.g., `\times` natively parsed as `<tab>imes`, `\nabla` as `<newline>abla`) were being silently evaluated by Python's standard `json.loads` within the streaming client (`plugin/modules/http/client.py`) before reaching our repair logic. Added `_SILENT_CORRUPTIONS` and updated `_repair_latex_clashes` to explicitly replace these literal control characters and word fragments with their properly double-escaped LaTeX equivalents. Additionally, implemented a structural fix by moving literal `\\n`/`\\t` expansion out of `content.py` and down into the specific `html` segment processing in `format_support.py`; this ensures `tex` math blocks bypass expansion entirely and preserve their backslashes. Added regression tests in `plugin/tests/test_writer_math_preservation.py`.
- **2026-05-02 (doc)**: Removed the deferred “sidebar living assistant” track; documented **Chat with Document** as the conversational alternative; fixed enable-location wording (Doc tab); renumbered sections.
- **2026-05-02 (queue)**: **`inflight_key`** no longer includes a fingerprint of the proofread slice. Same-key supersede and `_latest_seq` stale suppression now apply when the user types in the middle of a sentence (successive slices are not prefix-related). Regression: `test_mid_sentence_typing_dedup` in `test_grammar_work_queue.py`.
- **2026-05-04 (queue)**: Added **enqueue-time replace-in-place** to `_GrammarWorkQueue.enqueue()`. Uses CPython `queue.Queue` internals (`self._q.mutex`, `self._q.queue`) for an **O(1) tail check** to replace an existing same-`inflight_key` item with the incoming newer one — no new locks introduced. Drain-time `deduplicate_grammar_batch` is retained as a safety net for cross-key prefix dedup.
- **2026-05-07 (doc)**: Linked [LanguageTool-class phased plan](languagetool-local-parity-phased-plan.md) from §5 and `AGENTS.md`. Plan centers a **Python-first** checker consuming LT-open resources; JVM/Java not part of that roadmap (see §5 item 15).
- **2026-05-07 (doc)**: §1 — **Sentence-scoped native grammar** vs **`add_comment`** / chat for document-wide copyediting; clarifies LLM slice limits and why multi-sentence error dumps are avoided.
- **2026-05-07 (doc)**: §1 — Brief **LanguageTool** contrast (internal sentence segmentation; rules mostly per-sentence; some cross-sentence via special rules)—vs WriterAgent capped LLM context.
